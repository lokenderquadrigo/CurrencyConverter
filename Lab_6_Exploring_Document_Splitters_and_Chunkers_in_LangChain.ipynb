        "\n",
        "After loading documents into LangChain, you might need to transform them for optimal use in your application. One common transformation is splitting a long document into smaller segments to fit within your model's context window. LangChain provides several built-in document transformers to facilitate the splitting, combining, filtering, and manipulating of documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Process of Document Splitting:\n",
        "1. **Splitting into Chunks:**\n",
        "   - Break down the text into small, semantically meaningful units (typically sentences).\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Combining Chunks:**\n",
        "   - Assemble these smaller units into larger chunks until they reach a predefined size. This size is determined by a specific measurement function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Creating Overlapping Chunks:**\n",
        "   - Once the maximum size is reached, finalize the chunk as an independent text piece.\n",
        "   - Begin a new chunk, incorporating some overlap with the previous chunk to maintain textual context.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is a versatile tool within LangChain for splitting text based on a list of characters. This splitter is designed to handle various requirements through adjustable parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "This text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order until the chunks are small enough. The default list is [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Character List:** Utilizes a specified list of characters to determine where splits should occur.\n",

        "- **Overlap:** Configurable overlap between consecutive chunks to maintain context continuity across chunks.\n",

        "- **Split Character:** By default, it uses a empty string character (\"\") to split the text, but this can be customized to any character you specify.\n",
        "- **Chunk Size:** Allows you to define the length of each chunk in terms of the number of characters. This is useful for ensuring each piece of text is of a manageable size for processing.\n",
        "- **Overlap:** You can set the amount of overlap between consecutive chunks. This helps maintain context and continuity when text is split into separate parts.\n",

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.
